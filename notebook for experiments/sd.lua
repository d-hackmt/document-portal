\n\nThe pretraining pro
   cess of Llama 2 is based on the approach described in Section 2 of the paper. It ado
   pts most of the pretraining settings and model architecture from Llama 1, 
   utilizing a standard transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) 
   with pre-normalization via RMSNorm. The pretraining methodology builds 
   on the approach outlined in Touvron et al. (citation incomplete in the provided context).
    Additionally, the paper mentions that pretraining data investigations were 
    conducted to better understand the models\' capabilities and limitations 
    (referenced in Section 4.1). For detailed technical specifications, the full 
    pretraining methodology is described in Section 2 of the original paper.'
